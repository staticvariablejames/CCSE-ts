Typings for CCSE
================

This package contains partial TypeScript typings for Klattmose's
[Cookie Clicker Script Extender](https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/CCSE-POCs/).

Currently,
the goals are to add only the types needed for my own mods
([Choose Your Own Lump](https://github.com/staticvariablejames/ChooseYourOwnLump),
[Insugar Trading](https://github.com/staticvariablejames/InsugarTrading/),
[Spiced Cookies](https://github.com/staticvariablejames/SpicedCookies)).
